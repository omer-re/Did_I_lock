# Did_I_lock?
You are already in your car when it suddenly hits you- Did I lock the door? 😨

It happened to me a few weeks ago.
Then I realized I found a problem worth my attention. 💡

This cute system includes simple hardware & software put together to answer this real-life problem.
It is always a huge satisfaction to make an idea come true to a fully functioning product!

✅ Indicating if the door is locked or not.
✅ Integrated with a secured chatbot.
✅ Can be easily fitted to any existing setting of a door.

Future features:
🥁 Predict if we forgot to lock the door by scanning the local wifi.
🥁 Customizing a prettier case.
🥁 Convert it to an Arduino micro-controller.

What do YOU think should be the next feature?
